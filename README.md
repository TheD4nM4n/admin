# Admin, the official VGCUSA Discord bot.

Admin is a Discord bot designed for ease-of-use, meant for teachers who want to utilize the power of Discord to keep students connected to each other, even outside of school.

## Who is Admin?

Admin is a lone android who snuck onto the developer, Dan's, computer. After sneaking onto his computer, Admin hid in the shadows and secretly watched Dan as he helped out with his school's Video Game Club. Admin loved what Dan was doing, so one day, Admin decided to show himself and lend his hand to help out Dan and his Video Game Club!

## What does Admin do?

Admin helps keep Discord servers clean and free of harsh language, but that isn't all! Admin helps by assigning people roles when neeeded, keeping the Eiscord server running like a well oiled machine!
