## Who is Admin?

Admin is a lone android who sneaked onto the developer, Dan's, computer. After sneaking onto his computer, Admin hid in
 the shadows and secretly watched Dan as he helped out with his school's Video Game Club. Admin loved what Dan was doing, so one day, Admin decided to show himself and lend his hand to help out Dan and his Video Game Club!
